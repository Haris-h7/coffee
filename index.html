        <p> " In 1958 coffee was added to the list of foods and beverages recognized by the World Health Organization
            as safe for human health.
            Recent studies show that coffee assuages asthma bouts and allergies, prevents
            tooth decay, activates burning of fats in the body, replenishes potassium deficit and contributes to the
            improvement of cardiovascular function."</p>

                <h2>Types of Coffee beans</h2>
            </center>
            <ul type="square">
                <li id="l1"><strong>Arabica beans</strong> are by far the most popular type of coffee beans, making up
                    about 60%
                    of the world’s
                    coffee. These tasty beans originated many centuries ago in the highlands of Ethiopia, and may even
                    be the first coffee beans ever consumed! The name Arabica likely comes from the beans’ popularity in
                    7th-century Arabia (present-day Yemen).</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Robusta beans</strong> are larger and more rounded than the other bean varieties. These
                    plants typically grow
                    much larger than Arabica plants, measuring between 15 and 20 feet. Robusta beans are typically
                    considered to be hardier because they can grow at lower altitudes and resist diseases.This bean
                    originated in sub-Saharan Africa and is now grown primarily in Africa and Indonesia.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Coffea liberica</strong> is prized for its piquant floral aroma and bold, smoky flavor
                    profile. This hardy
                    species is frequently mixed with other varieties to add body and complexity, but rarely receives any
                    credit. Unheard of in Western civilization before the late 1800s, Liberica gained a foothold with
                    Southeast Asian coffee producers after a fungal disease (“coffee rust”) wiped out much of the
                    region’s Arabica crops.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Excelsa</strong> is the fourth major type of coffee bean. Though it was once considered a
                    separate coffee
                    species, scientists recently reclassified it as a Liberica variant.

                    Excelsa beans grow almost entirely in Southeast Asia, and they’re shaped somewhat like Liberica
                    beans — elongated ovals. These beans grow on large 20 to 30-foot coffee plants at medium altitudes.

                    <h2>Types of Roast</h2>
                </center>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li><strong>Light roasts</strong> are roasted for the least amount of time. Lightly roasted beans
                        generally reach an
                        internal temperature of 356°F – 401°F, right after the first crack occurs. These beans tend to
                        not have the oils on them because they haven’t been roasted at a high enough temperature.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Medium roaste</strong>d coffee reaches internal temperatures of 410°F-428°F. This is
                        after the first
                        crack and just before the second one occurs. They have a little bit more body than a light roast
                        and less acidity.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Medium-Dark Coffee Roasts</strong>Beans roasted to medium-dark reach an internal
                        temperature of 437°F – 446°F. This is during or just after the second crack. This roast will
                        also start showing the oils on the beans’ surface because the temperatures are high enough.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Dark roast</strong> the roasting temperature for roast is between 464°F – 482°F. There
                        are visible oils on
                        dark roast beans. Typically you cannot taste any origin flavors in a dark roast, just the
                        effects the roasting process has on that type of coffee bean.</li>
